        <p class="my-5 lg:text-base md:text-sm text-xs">The doctorate of Project Management (MA) program objective is to prepare students with the right technical skills to qualify them as individuals responsible for management roles in the construction and operation of major engineering projects. The Master of Project Management program is offered online via distance learning. After evaluating both academic records and life experience, AUST staff working in conjunction with Faculty and Academic Advisors will assist students in setting up a custom-made program, designed on an individual basis</p>
        <p class="my-5 lg:text-base md:text-sm text-xs">This flexibility to meet student needs is seldom found in other distance learning programs. Our online program does not require all students to take the same subjects/courses, use the same books, or learning materials. Instead, the oDoctorate of Project Management curriculum is designed individually by the student and academic advisor. It specifically addresses strengths and weaknesses with respect to market opportunities in the studentâ€™s major and intended field of work.</p>
