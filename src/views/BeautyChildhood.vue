            <p class="mt-5">Online diplomas are awarded for one to two years of study at a community college, technical school or university. If determined, students can complete an online diploma program while continuing to work, care for loved ones or fulfill other commitments. Online diploma programs are highly practical, allowing students to study a specific area, with a thorough overview of the field.</p>
            <p class="ms-10 my-5">Associate degrees usually take approximately two years when studying full time and are available at community colleges and technical schools around the world</p>
            <p class="mt-5">Summer courses are a great way to gain qualifications and academic credits in a convenient format. Offered during the summer months while some working professionals and students are taking a break, online summer courses fit nicely into a busy schedule. The web-based study format opens doors to studying at a university that is geographically distant, or at times that are most convenient for each individual student.</p>
