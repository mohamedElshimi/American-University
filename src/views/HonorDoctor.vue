        <p class=" md:text-base text-sm">An honorary doctoral degree is often awarded in recognition of one’s life experiences.<br>This means that the degree is bestowed as an honor rather than through the completion of certain academic requirements. Those who are honored with this title often do not have any prior connection to the award-giving institution.</p>
        <p class="mt-3 md:text-base text-sm"> They are often given to those who have either made contributions to a certain field, or more commonly as a “thank you” to those who have made large donations to the institution. Some famous examples of Honorary Doctors are Microsoft founder Bill Gates, the Italian opera signer Luciano Pavarotti, and Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar, to name a few.</p>
